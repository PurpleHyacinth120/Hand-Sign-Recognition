#Problem Statement
Communication through hand gestures plays a pivotal role in fields like assistive 
technologies and human-computer interaction. It serves as a natural and intuitive 
medium, particularly in scenarios where verbal communication is limited or 
impractical. Despite its significance, recognizing hand gestures dynamically in real 
time presents considerable challenges. Factors such as variations in hand sizes, 
differences in skin tones, diverse lighting conditions, and the inherent complexity of 
gestures make accurate recognition a demanding task. 
 
 
This project aims to address these challenges by developing a robust hand sign 
recognition system capable of identifying specific gestures with high accuracy. 
Leveraging Mediapipe for precise hand landmark detection, the system efficiently 
captures the intricate movements and positions of fingers and hands. A custom-trained 
machine learning model processes this data, ensuring reliable gesture classification 
across diverse environments. 
 
 
A key focus of the project is optimizing performance to ensure the system operates 
seamlessly on devices with minimal computational resources. This makes the solution 
accessible for applications like sign language translation, touchless interfaces, and 
gesture-based controls, even on low-power devices. By addressing these challenges, the 
project seeks to bridge the gap between technological advancements and real-world 
usability, contributing to more inclusive and interactive systems.
